<h4>Why are there so many Big Cat Sanctuaries in the US?</h4>

<p>
  There are as many as 10,000 big cats living in captvity in the US. These
  animals often live in terrible conditions: from private yards to unqualified
  roadside zoos. When big cats are confiscated, a lot of effort goes into
  finding them the proper placement and luckily, over the years, more and more
  sanctuaries are created to meet those needs. Big Cat Liberation is one of the
  recent ones to join the fight to end exotic animal ownership.
</p>

<h4>What we Do</h4>

<p>
  Our main mission is to Provide care and abundant habitats for large feline
  species to live in. Big cats should never be raised as pets but we believe
  everyone deserves a second change, especially the ones that can't speak for
  themselves. This is where our Big Cat Surrender Project comes into play.
</p>

<h4>Big Cat Surrender Project</h4>

<p>
  As exotic animal bans widen accross the nation, more and more unsafe
  businesses are closed down, leaving cats in need of a safe environment to
  spend the rest of their days at. Through Big Cat Surrender Project(BCSP), we
  seek individuals around the country to relinquish their big cats to us so we
  could offer them a second chance in life with professional care and
  environment most fitting to their natural needs.
